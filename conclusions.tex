We have extended the Modified Interior Penalty (MIP) form of Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) 
to arbitrary polygonal grids discretized with Piece-Wise Linear Discontinuous finite elements. 
The MIP-DSA solves employ the same discontinuous finite element trial spaces of the discrete \sn
transport equation.
%We proposed a simple way to compute the penalty coefficient on such grids. 
%
Numerical tests have been run on different grids with various types of polygonal cells,
demonstrating the effectiveness of MIP as a diffusion synthetic accelerator for 
\sn transport on arbitrary polygonal grids.
%
%. The advantage of is the potential 
%reduction of the numbers of unknowns and the possibility to use adaptive mesh 
%refinement without having hanging nodes. 
%
Fourier analyses show that a PWLD discretization of MIP diffusion synthetic accelerator 
is always stable, including for high-aspect ratio cells. 
%
Numerical experiments have been performed with mesh containing various types of polygonal cells, including
grids with different polygon types for a given problem and tests with degenerate polygons that mimic
grids obtained in adaptive mesh refinement strategies. In these tests, MIP-DSA always performed effectively,
reducing significantly the number of Source Iterations needed for convergence. 
We noted that the efficiency of MIP does not seem to \textcolor{red}{be affected by the meshes employed}. 
%
The MIP-DSA  matrix is SPD and we solved the corresponding linear system of equations using a standard Conjugate
Gradient method with different preconditioners. 
Algebraic multigrid techniques were found to be the most effective preconditioner with AGMG being more than 20 times
faster than unpreconditioned CG.
