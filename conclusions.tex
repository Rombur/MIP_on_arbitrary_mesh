\section{Conclusions} \label{sec_conc}
We have adapted the MIP-DSA to PieceWise Linear Discontinuous finite elements.
This allows to use this DSA on arbitrary polygonal meshes. The advantage of
using arbitrary polygonal mesh is the potential reduction of the numbers of
unknowns and the possibility to use adaptive mesh refinement without have to
treat hanging nodes. We have shown on a Fourier analysis than MIP on rectangular 
cell is always stable. We have also shown numerical examples that MIP is efficient 
even on highly unstructured meshes composed of different types of cell. We have also
compared different preconditioner for CG to solve MIP. Algebraic multigrid
methods were found to be the best preconditioner, AGMG being up to 20 times
faster than CG without preconditioning.
