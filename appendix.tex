\section{ML options}
The options used to solve MIP with ML are \cite{ml_guide}:
\begin{description}
\item [Uncoupled:] Attempt to construct aggregates of optimal size ($3^d$
nodes in $d$ dimensions). Each process works independently and aggregates
cannot span processes.
\item [MIS:] Uses maximal independent set techniques \cite{mis} to define
aggregates. Aggregates can span processes. May provide better quality
aggregates than {\bf Uncoupled}, but computationally more expensive because it
requires matrix-matrix product.
\item[Symmetric Gauss-Seidel] 
\item[Amesos-KLU:] Use {\bf KLU} through {\bf Amesos}. Coarse grid problem is
shipped to proc 0, solved and solution is broadcast.
\end{description}
The MultiLevelPreconditioner class provides default values for five different
preconditioner types, including classical smoothed aggregation for symmetric
and positive definite or nearly symmetric and positive definite systems.
\begin{description}
\item [option name:] SA
\item [max levels:] 10
\item [prec type:] V-cycle
\item [aggregation type:] Uncoupled-MIS
\item [aggregation dumping factor:] 4/3
\item [eigen-analysis type:] cg
\item [eigen-analysis iterations:] 10
\item [smoother sweeps:] 2
\item [smoother damping factor:] 1.0
\item [smoother pre or post:] both
\item [smoother type:] symmetric Gauss-Seidel
\item [coarse type:] Amesos-KLU
\item [coarse max size:] 128
\end{description}
