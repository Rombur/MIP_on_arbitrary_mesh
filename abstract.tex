  The Modified Interior Penalty (MIP) Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) technique
  is extended to the Piece-Wise Linear Discontinuous (PWLD) finite elements.
  This provides a DSA preconditioner for arbitrary 2D polygonal/3D polyhderal meshes. Arbitrary
  polygonal/polyhedral grids are used to model complex objects while decreasing the
  number of unknowns. Such grids can also be advantageously employed within an 
  adaptive mesh refinement process without the need to treat so-called ``hanging
  nodes'' between cells of different refinement depth. 
  The system of equations obtained by the MIP technique 
  is symmetric and positive definite. This linear system is typically solved using
  Conjugate Gradient (CG) preconditioned with a \textcolor{red}{Symmetric Gauss-Seidel}
  (SGS) scheme. In this research, we also compare SGS-preconditioned CG with 
  GG preconditioned using an Algebraic MultiGrid   methods (AMG). 
  Fourier analyses are 
  performed for the PWLD MIP formulation and we show that this scheme is
  always stable and effective at reducing the spectral radius for iterative transport
  solves, including for grids with high-aspect ratio cells.
  Numerical results are presented for three different unstructured meshes. 
  AMG preconditioning for the MIP system is shown to be significantly more effective 
  than SGS preconditioning.
