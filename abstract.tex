  The Modified Interior Penalty (MIP) Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) technique
  is extended to the Piece-Wise Linear Discontinuous (PWLD) finite elements.
  This \textcolor{red}{provides} a DSA preconditioner for arbitrary polygonal/polyhedral meshes. 
	Arbitrary grids can be used to model complex objects and can also be advantageously employed 
	within locally refined spatial grid without the need to treat so-called ``hanging
  nodes''. 
  The MIP technique yields a system of linear equations that is 
  is symmetric and positive definite. This system is typically solved using
  Conjugate Gradient (CG) preconditioned with a \textcolor{red}{Symmetric Gauss-Seidel}
  (SGS) scheme. In this research, we also compare SGS-preconditioned CG with 
  CG preconditioned using an Algebraic MultiGrid  method (AMG). 
  Fourier analyses are 
  performed for the PWLD MIP formulation and we show that this scheme is
  always stable and effective at reducing the spectral radius for iterative transport
  solves, including for grids with high-aspect ratio cells.
  Numerical results are presented for three different unstructured grids. 
  AMG preconditioning for the MIP system is shown to be significantly more efficient 
  than SGS preconditioning.
