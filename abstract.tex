  The Modified Interior Penalty (MIP) Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) technique
  is extended to the Piece-Wise Linear Discontinuous (PWLD) finite elements.
  This \textcolor{red}{provides} an efficient DSA preconditioner for arbitrary polygonal/polyhedral meshes. 
	Such arbitrary grids can be used to model complex objects; they can also be advantageously employed 
	with locally refined spatial grids without the need to deal with so-called ``hanging
  nodes''. 
  The MIP technique yields a system of linear equations that is 
  is Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD). This system may be solved using
  Conjugate Gradient (CG) preconditioned with a \textcolor{red}{Symmetric Gauss-Seidel}
  (SGS) scheme. In this research, we compare SGS-preconditioned CG with 
  CG preconditioned using an Algebraic MultiGrid method (AMG). 
  Fourier analyses are 
  performed for the PWLD MIP formulation and we show that this scheme is
  always stable and effective at reducing the spectral radius for iterative transport
  solves, including for grids with high-aspect ratio cells.
  Numerical results are presented for three different unstructured grids. 
  AMG preconditioning for the MIP system is shown to be significantly more efficient 
  than SGS preconditioning.
