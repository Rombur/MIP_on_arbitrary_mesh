Discontinuous diffusion synthetic acceleration for Sn transport on arbitrary polygonal meshes

- Introduction
Explain the advantages of using DSA, arbitrary polygons and algebraic multigrid to solve the DSA.


- MIP for PWLD
Introduce the PWLD basis functions (conference papers) and MIP for PWLD (see MIP paper)


- Algebraic multigrid
Explain how algebraic multigrid works (AGMG and ML ?). Advantages of algebraic multigrid over geometric multigrid.

Results:
 - Fourier Analysis 
	- vary c and Sn
	- vary optical thickness and Sn
	- vary aspect ratio and Sn

 - Numerical Results: Comparison of CG, CG-SSOR, CG-AMG
	- homogeneous, rectangle with random point disturbances and arbitrary polygons based on Triangle
	- iron-water, rectangle and arbitrary polygons with fake AMR
       

 - Conclusions
