\item [Uncoupled:] Attempt to construct aggregates of optimal size ($3^d$
nodes in $d$ dimensions). Each process works independently and aggregates
cannot span processes.
\item [MIS:] Uses maximal independent set techniques \cite{mis} to define
aggregates. Aggregates can span processes. May provide better quality
aggregates than \bf{Uncoupled}, but computationally more expensive because it
requires matrix-matrix product.
\item[Symmetric Gauss-Seidel]
\item[Amesos-KLU:] Use \bf{KLU} through \bf{Amesos}. Coarse grid problem is
shipped to proc 0, solved and solution is broadcast.

The MultiLevelPreconditioner class provides default values for five different
preconditioner types, including classical smoothed aggregation for symmetric
positive definite or nearly symmetric definite systems.
